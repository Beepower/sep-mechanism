# sep-mechanism

This folder contains the codes and data used in the article "Transformative market mechanism for renewable energy power system with generalized energy storage".

* main_example.m, corresponds to the Example section of the article and is used to present the transaction process of the proposed substitute energy price (SEP) market mechanism.

* main_case1.m, corresponds to the Case 1 in the Comparison and Contrast section of the article and is used to test the performance of the proposed SEP mechanism and the conventional locational marginal price (LMP) mechanism on valuing the regulation contribution.

* main_case2.m, corresponds to the Case 2 in the Comparison and Contrast section of the article and is used to test the performance of the proposed SEP mechanism and the LMP mechanism on reflecting the cost causality of regulation demand.

The above program files are written and run in Matlab 2018a environment. GUROBI and  YALMIP solver are also required.
